# ASSIGNMENT

Create a software prototype that presents a stream of haiku and conveys their experience.

**Constraints:**

1. Haiku are poems consisting of seventeen syllables broken into three lines. The first and last lines contain five syllables each; the middle line contains seven. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku

2. Please provide all source code and detail the steps needed to install and run the prototype on computers at IDEO (or provide installation/run scripts).  You can assume that the computers will have a package manager, such as Homebrew and can install needed 3rd party libraries, and that the reviewers will have some technical knowledge.  

3. I can provide a Dropbox location for you to place your source code or you can send using GitHub or some other version control system if you prefer, just let me know.

4. You can optionally send links to a working implementation of your prototype in addition to your source code.
